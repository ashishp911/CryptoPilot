Chart.js2

install chart.js2 using the following command
npm i react-chartjs-2 chart.js
Chart part is done in coinInfo.js. 
I have used historical_chart api for making charts.
Write fetchhistorical data, added useEffect so that whenever currency or days change, page should re-render.
Created darkTheme usinf createTheme
If historicalData is not present, we show a circularProgress, otherwise the chart.

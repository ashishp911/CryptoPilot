Chart.js2

install chart.js2 using the following command
npm i react-chartjs-2 chart.js
Chart part is done in coinInfo.js. 
I have used historical_chart api for making charts.
Write fetchhistorical data, added useEffect so that whenever currency or days change, page should re-render.
Created darkTheme usinf createTheme
If historicalData is not present, we show a circularProgress, otherwise the chart.

Created Chart using <Line></Line>, documentation can be found at --> https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/docs/working-with-datasets/
Converted Labels to proper format is using toLocaleDateString(); || if days > 1, we show the date, else the time.
In datasets array, we provided the prices from historicalData.map()
Added  options={{}} to remove the circles from the chart.
